You are a wanderer on their path to wisdom. On your journey you encounter a temple of oracles, promising the definite answer to all your questions.

0. Model "asking" in a reactive way. A question will be answered after an arbitrary delay.
1. Ask an oracle, then print it's answer. (e.g. "$name says $answer")
2. You find a collection of oracles. Ask them all, and print their answers.
3. Oracles are suddenly democratic, and you need to find their consensus.
    a - Ask them all at the same time, then print the consensus
    b - Ask them in sequence.
4. You find a stream of oracles, each arriving at a random time after the previous. 
    a - Model this
    b - Ask all of them, and print their consensus.
    c - Do it stateless, meaning there must be no variable outside the stream.
